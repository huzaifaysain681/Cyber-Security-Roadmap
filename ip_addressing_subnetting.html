                <h3>What is an IP Address?</h3>
                <p>An IP (Internet Protocol) address is a unique identifier assigned to every device connected to a network, allowing it to communicate with other devices over the internet or local network.</p>

                <h3>Types of IP Addresses</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>IPv4:</strong> The most common IP address format, written in a 32-bit format, such as 192.168.1.1.</li>
                    <li><strong>IPv6:</strong> A newer 128-bit IP address format, providing a larger address space, like 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>What is Subnetting?</h3>
                <p>Subnetting is the process of dividing a large IP network into smaller, more manageable segments called subnets. It helps optimize IP address allocation and manage network traffic efficiently.</p>

                <h3>Example of Subnetting</h3>
                <p>For instance, a company might use the network 192.168.1.0/24 and divide it into smaller subnets such as 192.168.1.0/28 to assign different subnets to HR, IT, and other departments.</p>

                <h3>Subnet Mask</h3>
                <p>A subnet mask defines which portion of an IP address belongs to the network and which belongs to the host. A typical subnet mask like 255.255.255.0 is used for dividing networks from host addresses.</p>

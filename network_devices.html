                <h3>Router</h3>
                <p>A router directs data packets between different networks. It's responsible for forwarding your data to its destination, like sending a request to the internet and routing the data back to your device.</p>
                <p><strong>Example:</strong> When you visit a website, your home router forwards the request to the internet and brings the response back.</p>

                <h3>Switch</h3>
                <p>A switch connects devices within the same network and forwards data based on MAC addresses. It helps devices on a local network communicate efficiently.</p>
                <p><strong>Example:</strong> In an office, a switch connects all computers, enabling file sharing and communication.</p>

                <h3>Firewall</h3>
                <p>A firewall filters incoming and outgoing network traffic to block unauthorized access and protect the network from threats.</p>
                <p><strong>Example:</strong> Your home router might have a firewall that blocks malicious traffic, protecting your devices.</p>

                <h3>Access Point (AP)</h3>
                <p>An Access Point allows wireless devices like smartphones and laptops to connect to a wired network via Wi-Fi.</p>
                <p><strong>Example:</strong> Your home Wi-Fi router acts as an access point, allowing your phone and laptop to connect to the internet wirelessly.</p>
